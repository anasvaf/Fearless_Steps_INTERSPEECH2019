This folder contains two subfolders for training and evaluation. Each folder has a wav file sampled at 8000 Hz. 
The original audio track was 30 min long but was cropped to fit the GitHub repo.

The idea is to give an understanding of the organization of our files. All the audio files can be downloaded for 
free at the following link: http://fearlesssteps.exploreapollo.org/download.php
